Hi, I'm Mauro Daprotis a freelancer, web developer from Argentina. I'm Always looking for the next big thing.

## Experience
I've been working for the last four years, co-founded a startup named [ReservateYa](https://twitter.com/reservateya) (currently offline 🙁) and developed various fullstack projects for local clients. From static sites to real-time web apps along with restful API and Progressive Web apps.

## Languages
I've worked with Javascript, PHP, Java, C, and others. Have experience with [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) databases.

## Interests
Currently, I'm most interested in the Javascript ecosystem. Specifically, [React](https://reactjs.org/) for fronted and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) for the backend. And looking forward [Graphql](https://graphql.org) API. I would love to get better at design 😄
